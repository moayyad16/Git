# Git Version Control
Note:

This guide is designed to help you learn Git in Visual Studio Code (VS Code), which has great built-in support for viewing your commit and branch history visually via Git Graph and Source Control. 

## Getting Started
1. Create your repo on your GitHub account to `push` your work on it.
2. Go to VS Code and clone the repo using `ctrl+shift+p`, then write `git: clone` in the search bar. Or you can choose `Clone Git Repository ...` from the graphical user interface in VS Code.

3. Enter your repo URL.
It may ask you to connect your GitHub account to VS Code; do so to follow up.
